I will launch my cooking blog introducing you a very simple recipe with spontaneus herbs, particularly red poppy, also known ass papaver rhoeas (or rosola in Italian).

Poppies are easy to spot during spring but also in winter.

**Papaver rhoeas salad:**

*Use only the smallest and most tender poppies.*

* 50 g. of clean papaver rhoeas for each person
* extra virgin olive oil 
* traditional balsamic vinegar of Modena
* salt

Put the herbs in bowl and mix thoroughly with olive oil, then add salt and some drops of traditional balsamic vinegar.
