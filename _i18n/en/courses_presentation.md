Cooking does not consist only in cutting ingredients, putting them in a pan and being careful not to burn them.

Cooking is also choosing the ingredients, handling them with care and combining them in the best way.

Understanding cooking techniques to bring out the flavors.

But also understanding what we eat every day, choosing better alternatives and, why not, saving some money without giving up on quality.
