Round cappelletti is a traditional type of pasta from San Marino and its surroundings. You can tell them apart from other types of capelletti because of their aspect: they look like small ravioli, but **round and smooth**.

They are meant to be served in broth and their raw meat filling will flavor both vegetable and meat broth.

Compared to *tortellini* and *tortellini a cappello* they have a more **delicate** taste and they are more nourishing, as the filling is cooked only one time.
