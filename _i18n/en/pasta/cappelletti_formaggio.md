Cheese cappelletti, just like *tortellini a cappello*, are inspired from **Romagna tradition**.

In this case the filling is a cheese cream wrapped in **priest hat** shaped pasta.

Cheese cappelletti are meant to be served in broth, but they taste good with any kind of sauce, like meat or fish, but especially with vegetable sauce. Or why not with mushrooms?
