Cappellini delle feste (literally *holiday cappelletti*) were born when I stumbled upon **raviggiolo cheese**.

It was still the tradional raviggiolo cheese, made only with goat milk. I immediately grew fond of it and started thinking about the best combination of ingredients to make a new filling and a new type of pasta.

A the beginning we used to make them only for **Easter and Christmas**, therefore the name. But the by popular demand, we started making them **all year**.

These *cappellini* are made according to **Romagna tradition**: a small ball of filling is placed on top of a tiny square of pasta that is then folded in the shape of a traditional **priest's hat**. Of all our fillings, this one's taste resembles the most to the traditional **sammarinese cappelletto**.
