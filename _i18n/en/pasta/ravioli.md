Ravioli are known by many names: agnolotti, panzarotti or tortelli. It is a traditional **filled pasta** that belongs to the culture of many countries, regions and households... each one with its peculiar recipe and shape.

Our ravioli have a creamy savoury filling where the **traditional tastes and flavos of our country** revolve around spinach and ricotta cheese.

The filling is wrapped in fresh pasta, **thin** but also **rough** to better bond with the sauce. 

We call them *light* (*magro* in Italian) but we just mean the do not contain meat.

There are many shapes that suits this kind of filling: square, triangle, half-moons, *tortelloni* or *cappelloni*...

You can serve them with **any kind of sauce**: vegetables, meat, fish or cheese. But since **they are already savoury** we usually suggest to serve them in the simplest way: with butter (or oil) and sage or parsley or parmesan cheese.
