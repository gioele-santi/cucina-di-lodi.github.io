Tortellini is a type of pasta inspired from **Emilia tradition**. The filling is made with **cooked meat** and it is wrapped in a small square of pasta, that is folded two times and then closed by joining two ends forming a ring around the finger and leaving a straight tip.

They have the shape of an hug but they are also called **Venus navel** because of they sensual shape.

According to tradition they should be served in broth, but you can use any sauce: butter and parmesan, cream, meat sauce, mushrooms...

Because of their shape they always stay **al dente** even if you slightly overcook them.
