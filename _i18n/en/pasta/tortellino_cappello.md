Tortellini a cappello are inspired from **Romagna tradition**. The filling is rich and fragrant and wrapped in a small square of pasta that is folded only one time and the two ends are overlapped so that it forms two pointy ends.

These two pointy ends, remind of a traditional **priest hat**, hence the name (*cappello* means hat in Italian).

As *tortellini* they are meant to be served in broth but can be served with any type of broth.

Compared to *tortellini* they are more **tender**.
